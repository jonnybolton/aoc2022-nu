# Advent of Code 2022: nu
I am using [2022's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge as an exercise to learn nu.

## Prerequisites
- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/).

## Running
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the project
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:jonnybolton/aoc2022-nu.git
   cd aoc2022-nu
   ```
2. Download the puzzle input files from the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2022). You will be required to create an account if you do not have one.
3. Run the code for a particular day with the following command
   ```

   For example
